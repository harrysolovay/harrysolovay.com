  title: `Mobile Computing & Mental Health`,
  description: `I conducted this study on the implications of mobile computing use on mental health. 77 participants completed psychological batteries representing their depression, self-esteem, and level of phone addiction. They also reported the amount of weekly time spent on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Email. The findings of this research are so shocking that I switched to a dumb phone from 10 years ago.`,
